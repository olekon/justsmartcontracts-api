# What is it?
JustSmartContracts.dev is a place where you can “bookmark” certain Ethereum smart contracts and then watch for their properties and events or call functions in a user-friendly manner.


JustSmartContracts.dev was designed for Ethereum developers in the first place. But anybody can make use of it.


JustSmartContracts.dev is a front-end tool. All the data including your contracts' addresses and their ABI is stored in the web browser's local storage.  


JustSmartContracts.dev is an open-source project. Our repository is [here](https://github.com/olekon/justsmartcontracts), feel free to study it and join us.
